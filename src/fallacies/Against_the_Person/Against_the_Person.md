# **Against the Person (Ad Hominem)**

### **`X ➜ Attacks Character of ➜ Y ➜ Instead of the Argument`**

---

Person (X) responds to Person (Y)'s argument
by attacking **Y's character, traits, or circumstances**,
rather than **engaging with the argument itself**.

This is meant to **undermine credibility** without addressing the logic or evidence presented.
